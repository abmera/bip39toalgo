# BIP39 Mnemonic to Algorand Secret

Forked version. See README1.md for notices

See the original version at <https://github.com/abmera/bip39toalgo>

## Motivation
As a paranoid long-term Algo holder with a Ledger wallet, this tool is the answer to the question: 
> *What if my Ledger device malfunctions or I misplace it and don't have access to a new one?*

While some advances have been made in terms of interoperability and recoverability across wallet clients 
(more details in [WalletsRecovery](https://walletsrecovery.org/)), there is still a considerable amount of 
inconsistencies. Thus, I couldn't just enter my Ledger recovery phrase (BIP39 mnemonic) in another 
multi-account wallet like Coinomi, Exodus or Trust. Also, I wanted to have the Algorand native 25-word 
recovery phrase in paper so that I could use in the official app to access my funds as a backup plan.

## How to Use
### Web App
---
Go to the live webapp: <https://a-maugli.github.io/bip39toalgo/bip39toalgo-webapp.html>  
To use the main functionality of this tool:

1. Select the `Mnemonic Tool` tab
2. Enter your wallet `BIP39 mnemonic` (12-24 words recovery phrase)
3. Choose your `Wallet Client` (currently known derivation paths for: Atomic, Coinomi, Exodus, Ledger and Trust)
4. Press `Start`
5. Confirm that the `Algorand Address` displayed matches your current address
6. Write down your secret in a piece of paper and store it in a secure place. **Do not take a screenshot! Take the necessary precautions to store your secret!**

If your `Wallet Client` is not listed you could use the `Search` functionality which will try multiple derivation method/path combinations to find one that matches your `Current Address`, or play around with the `Custom` option.

#### Offline Usage
1. Download the [Standalone Web App](https://a-maugli.github.io/bip39toalgo/bip39toalgo-webapp.zip)
2. Disconnect from the Internet
3. Unzip the file and open the `bip39toalgo-webapp.html` file

### Node app
---
1. Download and clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/a-maugli/bip39toalgo`
2. Change directory to project folder `bip39toalgo`
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Main app code is in `src/bip39toalgo.js`

```javascript
const {
    deriveMnemonic,
    wallets,
    prettifyWordsTTB
} = require('./bip39toalgo')

mnemonic = 'all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all feel'
deriveMnemonic(mnemonic, wallets.ledger.method, wallets.ledger.path)
.then(node => {
    console.log(node.algo.key)
    console.log(node.algo.address)
    words = prettifyWordsTTB(node.algo.words)
    console.log(words)
})

## Derivation Method
`slip10-ed25519` uses [SLIP10](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0010.md) standard with elliptic curve ed25519  
`slip10-secp256k1` uses [SLIP10](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0010.md) standard with elliptic curve secp256k1  
`kholaw-ed25519` implements paper from D. Khovratovich and J. Law, " [BIP32-Ed25519: Hierarchical Deterministic Keys over a Non-linear Keyspace](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7966967)", 2017 IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy Workshops (EuroS&PW), 2017, pp. 27-31, doi: 10.1109/EuroSPW.2017.47.  
`bip39-seed` does not derive the key, uses first 32 bytes of the BIP39 seed
